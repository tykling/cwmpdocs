    Summary:
    This document defines objects for use in CWMP managed devices.  The objects
    may exist at the top level of a hierarchy, or in some cases within an 
    existing object.  The objects are intended for use in all CWMP Root 
    objects. The objects define varying functionality, diagnostics, etc. that 
    are agnostic to the type of device.
